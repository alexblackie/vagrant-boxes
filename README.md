# BlackieOps Vagrant Templates

## Building

1. `cd` into the directory
2. `vagrant destroy -f` if you've built the VM previously
3. `vagrant up` to build the VM
4. `vagrant package` to generate a compressed `package.box`

Then you can rename and upload the `.box` file to wherever, or import it
locally.
